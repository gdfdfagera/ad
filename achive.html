                <h3>Political achievements</h3>
                <p>An important stage in the history of Kazakhstan was the achievements of the Alash Orda, a national liberation movement aimed at establishing an independent state. One of the key successes was the successful unification of the Kazakhs, previously divided into various administrative units. This achievement was the result of nationally oriented activities and the creation of national structures that contribute to the formation of a common political consciousness.

                    The founding event was the declaration of independence in 1917, when the Alash Orda established the Alash Republic. This important step emphasized the Kazakhs' desire for political autonomy and self-determination, asserting their sovereignty and creating the basis for the formation of their own state. However, this period of independence turned out to be temporary, as Alash Orda faced pressure from the Soviet authorities.
                    
                    These achievements of the Alash Orda became the cornerstone of the cultural revival of the Kazakh people, contributing to the formation of a national identity and emphasizing the importance of self-determination of the nation in a period of political and social change.

            <div class="pol" id="Cultural">
                <h3>Cultural and educational achievements</h3>
                <p>An important area of activity of the Alash Orda was the active maintenance and development of Kazakh culture. During the period of national reconstruction, the organization sought to strengthen the cultural and linguistic identity of the Kazakhs. Activities were carried out aimed at preserving and disseminating cultural heritage, which helped strengthen national unity.

                    An important aspect was educational reforms aimed at improving education in the Kazakh language. Alash Orda made significant efforts to expand the network of schools and other educational institutions, which contributed to increasing the level of literacy and education of the population. These efforts in the educational sphere were of strategic importance for the preservation and strengthening of Kazakh culture, as education became a means of transmitting language and traditions to future generations.
                    
                    Taken together, the cultural and educational achievements of the Alash Orda not only contributed to the strengthening of the Kazakh identity, but also created the basis for the sustainable development of society. These cultural and educational efforts became an important element of the strategy for national revival and the formation of a strong, self-conscious nation.

                <h3>Economic achievements</h3>
                <p>During the formation and development of the Alash Republic at the beginning of the 20th century, important steps were taken in the economic sphere aimed at improving the situation of Kazakh peasants and ensuring fair distribution of land. One of the key areas was land reforms, which were undertaken to support the peasant population and establish a fair order in matters of land relations.

                    The land reforms undertaken sought to improve the overall situation of Kazakh peasants by providing them with access to land for agriculture. These efforts were aimed at creating conditions for the sustainable development of the rural sector of the economy, improving the standard of living of the population and ensuring food security of the republic.
                    
                    Along with land reforms, active steps were taken to develop the economy of the Alash Republic as a whole. Particular attention was paid to the development of agriculture and industry. Modern agricultural methods, new technologies and effective management practices were introduced in the rural sector to increase land productivity and ensure sustainable development of the rural economy.
                    
                    In parallel with this, measures were taken in industry to create new enterprises, develop manufacturing sectors and attract investment. Industrial development was aimed at diversifying the economy, increasing production capacity and creating jobs, which contributed to the overall growth of employment and welfare of the population.
                    
                    Thus, land reforms and economic development became important components of the strategy for strengthening the Alash Republic at the beginning of the 20th century. These measures not only contributed to improving the situation of Kazakh peasants, but also created the basis for the sustainable economic development of the republic as a whole.
